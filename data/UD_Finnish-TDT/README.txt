# Summary

UD_Finnish-TDT is based on the Turku Dependency Treebank (TDT), a broad-coverage dependency treebank of general Finnish covering numerous genres. The conversion to UD was followed by extensive manual checks and corrections, and the treebank closely adheres to the UD guidelines.

# Introduction

The treebank contains texts from Wikipedia articles, Wikinews articles, University online news, Blog entries, Student magazine articles, Grammar examples, Europarl speeches, JRC-Acquis legislation, Financial news, and Fiction sourced from 674 individual documents. The original annotation of the treebank was in Stanford Dependencies, including secondary dependencies, and fully manually checked morphological annotation. The treebank is also accompanied by a PropBank annotation (http://turkunlp.github.io/Finnish_PropBank/) and a dependency parser pipeline substantially outperforming the baseline UDPipe model (https://turkunlp.org/Turku-neural-parser-pipeline/).
